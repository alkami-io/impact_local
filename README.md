# Project Overview

The impactLocal project is an open source project sponsored by Alkami, LLC.  The project focus is to create a web based application aime at increasing engagement in State, county and city level politics.  Future phases will include national level politics.  However, there are a number of sites looking to create engagement at a national level, we believe that impact at local levels are very under represented and in some ways, just as or more important than engagement at the National level. 

This Readme and subseqent Wiki and Waffle boards will be updated as the project rolls along. 

If you have questions about this project, please contact the Alkami Team Lead, Robert Cornell at robert at alkami dot io with any questions.

Thank you,

Alkami's Social Impact Team
